General Query Engine for Learning Propose

## Overview

Inspired by [How Query Engines Work](https://howqueryengineswork.com/00-introduction.html), this project aims to develop a Python-based query engine. A query engine is a software that executes queries against data, providing answers to various data-related questions. Query engines are fundamental in data analytics, enabling users to extract meaningful insights from large datasets through a simplified query language or API​​.

## Features

**Data Processing and Analysis**: Our engine will be capable of executing complex queries, including but not limited to aggregations, joins, and filters.

**Support for SQL**: Given the widespread use of SQL, our engine will provide robust support for this language, allowing users familiar with relational databases to easily adapt​​.

**Big Data Compatibility**: Addressing the limitations of SQL in big data contexts, our engine will be flexible enough to handle large-scale data processing, possibly integrating with technologies like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark​​.

## Technical Framework
Language: Python, chosen for its simplicity and wide adoption in the data science community.

Inspiration from Apache Arrow: We'll draw design insights from the Apache Arrow project, particularly its efficient memory format for columnar data processing, allowing for high-performance operations on modern hardware​​.

Inter-Process Communication (IPC): Our engine will utilize IPC for efficient data transfer, inspired by Apache Arrow's use of Google Flatbuffers for metadata exchange​​.

## Goals

Ease of Use: To create a user-friendly interface, making data querying accessible for both developers and non-technical users.

Performance: Focus on high-performance data processing, leveraging Python's capabilities and learning from projects like DataFusion and Ballista within the Apache Arrow framework​​​​.

Scalability: Design the engine to efficiently handle large datasets, possibly integrating with distributed computing platforms.

## Community and Contributions
We encourage community involvement and contributions. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a beginner, your insights and code contributions are valuable to the project's growth.
